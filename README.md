## Knowledgebase Archives
To reduce duplication of pages there is currently no archive setup for knowledgebases. To create a knowledge base archive simply create a new page in the services listing folder called archive-knowledgebase-surveys.md and paste the front matter from its parent. Make the following changes.

* **Layout** - Change layout to layout-listing.
* **Permalink** - Modify permalink to match archive link in parent knowledge base.
* **Summaries** - Modify the headings as necessary
