<a id="intro"></a>Our team of BOHS P402 qualified and experienced surveyors will:

* Locate any materials that may contain asbestos
* Tell you what risk level the asbestos presents
* Give you advice on what to do next
* Provide you with an easy to read report that details the findings and next steps
* Be on-hand to answer your questions

> **“In every case I discuss the project with you. I have been helping our clients navigate the complex dangers of asbestos since 2002.”** Dr Tim Hamilton, Asbestos Expert and MD of Scientific Services

We survey domestic, commercial and industrial properties across Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset.

## About your survey<a id="about">

### Easy to understand - Pinpoints the risk - Provides you with next steps

<div class="uk-overflow-hidden" uk-scrollspy="cls:uk-animation-kenburns"><img src="/images/uploads/main-surveyor-building-site.jpg" alt="Image of asbestos surveyor on building site"></div>

A Scientific Services survey will help you pinpoint any asbestos risk. To judge the risk we take an holistic approach,examining variables including:

* **Type of asbestos:** There are six types of asbestos, e.g. Chrysotile, Amosite. All are carcinogenic but some are easier to manage.
* **Type of building component**: E.g. The risk associated with asbestos cement is considered to be much lower than asbestos insulation. Because the fibres are tightly bound within the material's matrix.
* **Condition of the component:** E.g. a damaged building component exposing asbestos fibres presents a highrisk.
* **Location of the asbestos:** The problem may or may not pose a risk to occupants. For example: a lockedroom with contamination is not a risk in a building with no occupant.
* **Type of activity:** E.g. a sports hall with asbestos insulation board ceiling panels would present a high risk if children will be kicking a ball around. A ball could damage the panels and expose fibres
* **Intention:** If asbestos is present and the area is to be refurbished by tradespeople then there is a high risk - see refurbishment survey.

> **“Scientific Services reports are easy to understand. I was able to see the risks and what I should donext. Tim was on-hand to clarify any points. His helpful approach meant we were able to create aroadmap for moving forward.”** A N Customer.

### Choosing the right survey type

There are two main types of asbestos survey. But they vary in size, complexity and their purpose. We will guide you so that you know which one to select.

One way to decide what survey you need, is to ask why you require a survey.

#### Management Survey

**Required when:**

* There are no planned modifications to the building.
* You need to find out where asbestos is and create a management plan.
* You need to safeguard the existing occupants whilst they do their normal activities.

A management survey is a relatively non-invasive survey. The surveyor will examine everything that you can see, i.e. that doesn't need removing to examine. For example, this includes: walls, ceilings, floors and accessible voids.

If a management survey doesn't find asbestos containing materials. It should not be assumed that the building is completely asbestos free. Asbestos may be concealed within the building. A demolition or refurbishment survey would confirm this.

#### Demolition or Refurbishment Survey

**Required when:**

* You plan to complete works that will affect the fabric, fixtures and fittings of the building.
* You're planning to knock down or alter the structure of the building.
* You need to protect yourself and the tradespeople involved.

A demolition survey (also known as a refurbishment survey) is an invasive survey. The surveyor will examine everything within a predetermined area. This may be within a couple of rooms if works are planned within one section of a building. Alternatively if a building is to be demolished the entire premises would be surveyed. A deep examination of the total structure of the building will be undertaken, e.g. behind walls.

Demolition surveys will damage the fabric of the building to give sampling access.
